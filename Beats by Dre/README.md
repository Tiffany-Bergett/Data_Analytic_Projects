### Description:

This project is a comprehensive business intelligence analysis demonstrating skills in the full data analysis lifecycle, from foundational research and data preparation to advanced analysis and final recommendations. The deliverables include a strategic AI Slide-Deck presentation and an AI-driven dashboard.

### Process:

1. **Foundational Research:** Developed an "Ideal Consumer List" and a "Customer Journey Map" using the AIDA framework.
2. **Data Acquisition & Cleaning:** Used Python to scrape and import a dataset of over 5,000 Survey Responses and Amazon reviews. Applied Pandas to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed a detailed EDA to explore data distributions and relationships between variables, including creating a correlation matrix and word clouds using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
4. **Advanced Analysis:** Conducted a sentiment analysis on customer reviews using the TextBlob, nltk, wordcloud, and Gemini API libraries.
5. **Final Deliverables:** Created a strategic presentation for a Gamma AI slide deck and a Claude AI-driven dashboard to present key findings and actionable recommendations to stakeholders.

### Data:
Amazon reviews for portable speakers from top competitors:
* **JBL:** A competitor known for durable, bass-focused speakers.
* **Bose:** A competitor recognized for premium 360 sound.
* **Sony:** A competitor known for compact and rugged designs.
* **Marshall:** A competitor with a stylish, classic design.

### Assumptions:
1. The 5,000 Amazon reviews are a representative sample of consumer sentiment for the targeted products.
2. Customer reviews accurately reflect the key pain points and strengths that are most important to consumers.

### Findings:
* A significant portion of consumers are willing to pay a premium for sound quality; **20% of users** spent over `$200` on their current speaker.
* Gen Z and Millennials show the strongest purchase intent and have specific feature preferences. Gen Z prioritizes **clarity, powerful bass, and loudness**, while Millennials value **balanced sound** and **brand reputation**.
* Qualitative analysis of reviews revealed specific pain points:
  * **Beats Pill:** Frequent mentions of bass distortion.
  * **Marshall:** Complaints about app issues and charging ports.
  * **JBL:** Reviews often cited concerns with battery life.
  * 
### Recommendations:
* **Targeted Product Development:** Dominate the market by excelling in core features that matter most to consumers, namely **superior sound** (low distortion, clear bass) and **premium design** (anodized aluminum, minimalist aesthetic).
* **Strategic Marketing:** Implement a digital-first marketing strategy with targeted content for Gen Z (short, bass-heavy videos) and Millennials (high-quality content on sound and design).
* **Competitive Pricing:** Price the new product between `$249` and `$299` to capture the premium segment of the market.
  
### Notes:
* The project extensively utilized AI tools (Gemini and Claude) for qualitative data analysis and dashboard creation, showcasing a modern, tool-agnostic approach to data analysis.
* The project was completed as part of a structured, real-world externship, with deliverables reviewed by industry professionals.
