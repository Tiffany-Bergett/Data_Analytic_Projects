### Description:
- Microsoft Excel, 6 Sheets
- Includes Conclusions, change-log, assumptions, 2 user-created tables, 2 Pivot Tables, 3 Charts, and formulas including functions AVERAGE and FORECAST.ETS

### Process:
1) Clean data
        -Switch Rows/Columns
        -Change the data format to a number
        -Replace "null" with blanks
2) Create a Manual pivot  table  "Yearly Debt"
        -Add calculated fields for yearly increases.
        -Create Chart
3) Create a Pivot Table for monthly averages
        -Create Chart
4) Create a Pivot Table for max debt
        -Edit for forecasting
        -Create Chart
5) Create Executive Summary

### Data
US Public Debt and Intragovernmental Holdings from 1993 to 2023:
- `'Record Date'`: The date the debt was posted.
- `'Debt Held by the Public'`: Cumulative Yearly debt held by all US citizens combined.
- `'Intragovernmental Holdings'`: Cumulative Yearly debt held by the US government on behalf of its citizens.
- `'Total Public Debt Outstanding'`: Combined debt of the public and the government.

### Assumptions:
1) 2023 is excluded due to unfinished data entries.
2) When looking for a yearly change, only the last day of each year is needed due to its cumulative nature.

### Findings:
- The average debt increase between 2001-2022 to the public is 10% and intragovernmental is 5%, making the total increase 8%.						
- The average debt increase from the last 10 years 2013-2022 to the public is 8%, and intragovernmental is 4%, making the total increase 7%.						
- Peak years for debt increase were 2008 and 2020; These years correspond to a US recession and a pandemic response in the US, respectively.											
- The highest debt increases historically occur during the months of January, December, and November; These months are common for holiday debt.						
- The lowest debt increases historically occur during the months of April, May, and June; These months have no major holidays.											
- From 1997 to 2007, we saw an increase of about 1 trillion in publicly held debt.					
- From 2008 to 2018, we saw an increase of 9 trillion in publicly held debt.						
- From 2019 to 2022, we saw an increase of 7 trillion in publicly held debt.						
- From 2023 to 2027, it is projected to increase by 7 trillion in publicly held debt.					

### Recommendations/Results:
- Publicly held debt is projected to increase at a steady rate over the next 5 years.					
- Research the stock market, housing market, credit card purchase trends, and unemployment rate to determine the cause of the increase.
