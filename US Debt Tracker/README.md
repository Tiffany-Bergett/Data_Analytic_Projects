Create Executive Summary

#### Data
US Public Debt and Intragovernmental Holdings from 1993-2023:
- `'Record Date'`: The date the debt was posted.
- `'Debt Held by the Public'`: Cumulative Yearly debt held by all US citizens combined.
- `'Intragovernmental Holdings'`: Cumulative Yearly debt held by the US government on behalf of its citizens.
- `'Total Public Debt Outstanding'`: Combined debt of the public and the government.

#### Assumptions:
- 2023 is excluded due to unfinished data entries.
- When looking for a yearly change, only need the last day of each year due to its cumulative nature.

#### Findings:
1) The average debt increase between 2001-2022 to the public is 10% and intragovernmental is 5%; making the total increase 8%.						
2)  The average debt increase from the last 10 years 2013-2022 to the public is 8% and intragovernmental is 4%; making the total increase 7%.						
3) Peak years for debt increase were 2008 and 2020; These years correspond to a US recession and a pandemic response in the US, respectively.											
4) Highest debt increases historically occur during the months of January, December, and November; These months are common for holiday debt.						
5) The lowest debt increases historically occur during the months of April, May, and June; These months have no major holidays.											
6) From 1997-2007 we saw an increase of about 1 Trillion in publicly held debt.						
7) From 2008-2018 we saw an increase of 9 Trillion in publicly held debt.						
8) From 2019-2022 we saw an increase of 7 Trillion in publicly held debt.						
9) From 2023-2027 it is projected to an increase of 7 Trillion in publicly held debt.						

#### Recommendations/Results:
- Publicly held debt is projected to increase at a steady rate over the next 5 years.						
- Research the stock market, housing market, credit card purchase trends, and unemployment rate to determine the cause of the increase.
